Crime Management System

A Java-based application designed to digitize and streamline the management of crime records and police station operations. This project was developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course at the **Université française d'Égypte (UFE)**.

## About The Project

This system allows law enforcement administrators to manage sensitive data regarding crimes, criminals, and police officers efficiently. It serves as a practical implementation of OOP concepts, focusing on modularity, data security, and efficient record-handling.

### Key Objectives
- **Digitization:** Replace manual paperwork with a digital record system.
- **OOP Implementation:** Demonstrate the use of Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Polymorphism in a real-world scenario.
- **Data Management:** efficient handling of criminal profiles and case files.

## Features

* **Authentication:** User Profiles with each profile accessing certain functionalties 
* **Case Management:** Create, update, and close crime case files.
* **Criminal Profiling:** Maintain detailed records of suspects and convicted criminals.
* **Officer Management:** Track police officers, their ranks, and assigned cases.
* **Search & Retrieval:** Quickly look up cases or individuals in the system.

## Built With

* **Language:** [Java](https://www.java.com/)
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
* **Goal** Demonstrate understanding of OOP concepts

### Prerequisites
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or higher) installed on your machine.
